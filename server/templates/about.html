                    <h1 class="font-bold text-4xl pt-2">What is kidney disease?</h1>
                    <p class="pt-2">Kidney diseases are conditions affecting the function of the kidneys, which are essential organs for filtering blood and eliminating waste from the body. They can take various forms, such as kidney failure, kidney infections, kidney stones and genetic kidney disease. Risk factors include high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and poor diet.</p>
                    <p class="pt-2">Kidney disease can be detected by blood and urine tests to assess kidney function and detect abnormalities such as protein or blood in the urine. Imaging techniques such as ultrasound can also be used to visualise the structure of the kidneys and identify problems such as cysts or kidney stones. It is important to consult a doctor if you experience symptoms such as persistent back pain, urinary problems or swelling, as early detection is crucial for effective treatment of kidney disease.</p>
                    <h1 class="font-bold text-4xl">The Nephropatie IGA</h1>
                    <p class="pt-2">IgA nephropathy, or Berger's disease, is a chronic kidney disorder characterised by the abnormal accumulation of immunoglobulin A in the kidneys, causing inflammation and progressive damage. Symptoms usually include blood in the urine, high blood pressure and swelling of the legs.</p>
                    <p class="pt-2">This disease is characterised by different lesions depending on a number of criteria found in its symptoms.</p>
                    <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl">The 4 differents lesions</h1>
                    <li class="font-bold text-2xl">M</li>
                    <p class="pt-2">The "M" in IgA nephropathy stands for immunoglobulin A, an immune system protein. In this disease, excessive amounts of IgA accumulate in the kidney glomeruli, triggering inflammation and progressive damage to the kidneys. This leads to symptoms such as blood in the urine, high blood pressure and swelling. The course of IgA nephropathy can vary from mild to advanced renal failure.</p>
                    <li class="font-bold text-2xl">E</li>
                    <p class="pt-2">The "E" in IgA nephropathy refers to enterocytes, which are cells found in the intestine where the IgA-associated immune response generally occurs. In IgA nephropathy, there is an alteration in the mechanism by which IgA is produced and eliminated by the enterocytes, leading to its accumulation in the kidneys. This intestinal dysfunction contributes to the development of kidney disease by disrupting immune homeostasis.</p>
                    <li class="font-bold text-2xl">S</li>
                    <p class="pt-2">The "S" in IgA nephropathy represents the syndrome, as this condition is often associated with a set of characteristic symptoms, such as blood in the urine, proteinuria (presence of protein in the urine), high blood pressure and an increased risk of kidney failure. This syndrome is the result of the abnormal accumulation of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the glomeruli of the kidneys, causing inflammation and damage to the kidneys. IgA nephropathy syndrome can vary in severity, from a mild illness to end-stage renal failure requiring a kidney transplant.</p>
                    <li class="font-bold text-2xl">C</li>
                    <p class="pt-2">The "C" in IgA nephropathy refers to the component, indicating that this disease is characterised by abnormal deposits of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the renal glomeruli. These deposits trigger an inflammatory response and damage to the kidneys, leading to symptoms such as blood in the urine, high blood pressure and swelling. The IgA component is central to the pathogenesis of the disease, distinguishing IgA nephropathy from other kidney disorders.</p>
                    <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl pt-2">Oxford Score</h1>
                    <p class="pt-2">The Oxford score assesses the severity of kidney disease according to the 4 different lesions listed above. This score is used to stratify the risk of disease progression and to help guide the treatment and management of patients with IgA nephropathy. Higher scores generally indicate more severe disease and an increased risk of renal complications.</p>
                    <p class="pt-2"> This score is characterised by the presence or absence of a certain lesion (M-score: 0/1; E-score: 0/1; S-score: 0/1; C-score: 0/1) as well as a ratio indicating how many lesions were observed on all the crops (M-ratio: 10 | 23; E-ratio: 0 | 23; S-ratio: 0 | 23; C-ratio:0 | 23).</p>
                    <h1 class="font-bold text-4xl">MESCnn</h1>
                    <p class="pt-2">MESCnn is a segmentation and classification algorithm. This algorithm uses a WSI and segments each glomerulus into a crop. The algorithm then classifies each crop to determine the state of the disease.</p>

                    <p class="pt-2">Our kidney classification project offers a promising prospect by providing physicians with a structured framework for assessing and classifying renal conditions such as IgA nephropathy. By using objective, standardised criteria, this project facilitates clinical decision-making by helping doctors to rapidly identify specific features of the disease in patients, which can optimise diagnosis and choice of treatment.</p>
